The user is shown a text box where they can enter text,
 and if they do, we call the submit() function. 
 The function copies what the user has typed into the 
 output div tag, and clears the div tag if the text box is empty.

submit() function just copies what the user types into the output.
We want it to also check whether the user has made a spelling error.

so just like search API call, I don't want to correct the user everytime(may be later we
can do something like suggestion) but let say I will only show grammatical error once 
the user press spacebar/enter

Just to make it short:
let say after the user press spacebar/or somehow we know, user has completed a word

we can all our function 

spellCheck() {
    //this should take a word as input 
    //or last char is whitespace then that last word should be passed in this fn;
    //return the correct spelling of last word
}
